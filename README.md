# Queuing-System-Simulation
Computer Simulation in which queues are the basic data structure and using the Poisson distribution to determine the number of customers arriving at a given time unit. This simulation models the behavior of queuing systems modeled as a time-driven simulation in which queues of objects are waiting to be served by various servers.
